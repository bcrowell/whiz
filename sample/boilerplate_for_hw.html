Sometimes different problems are assigned randomly to different students, and that's why you had to put
in your student ID number to generate this list.
</p>

<p>
A notation like 2-5 means chapter 2, problem 5.
</p>

<p>
Problems labeled "online" are in Spotter, which is explained in the syllabus.
The full statement of each problem is in the
book, not in Spotter. For these problems, you have to do <i>both</i> of the following things to get
credit: (1) check the answer in Spotter and get it right, and (2) show your work on the paper
that you turn in. If you're getting the wrong answer in Spotter and don't know how to get it right,
please come to my office hours for help! My office hours are listed on the front page of the syllabus.

I'd appreciate it if you would:
</p>

<ol>
<li> Leave about an inch of empty space at the top of the front page of
  your homework, so I can write your scores on the problems there.
<li> Just below that, write the list of problems you were assigned (which may be different from what
  other students were assigned).
</ol>

<p>
Solutions for some problems, marked with an "s" below, are given in the back of the book.
Try to solve these without
peeking at the solution, then use the solution to check yourself. 
These problems are not for credit, and you don't need to turn in your work.
</p>

<p>
Problems labeled * are more difficult problems that are not required and are meant for students
at the top of the bell curve who don't find the regular homework challenging.
These are not for points, but if you do one and would like feedback,
please write me an eye-catching note on your homework paper so I'll know to look at it.
</p>
  
<p>
Note that in many of the homework problems, you need to look up data
in the back of the book.

<p>
If a problem doesn't exist in your printed copy of the book, you can get it
in the latest online version of the book at
<a href="http://www.lightandmatter.com">lightandmatter.com</a>.
