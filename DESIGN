  syll_schedule.rb
    ... library that handles the eruby embedded in syll.tex
  whiz
    ... does all the database manipulations
  howdy
    ... now only used for solutions
hw.yaml
  edited by hand
  see sample_file for format and how it looks after being parsed and made into json
  can have comments, # ...
  quotes are optional, but when in doubt, use them, because things like commas are active syntactically
  notes
    can be prefaced with:
      label of problem; in this case, can refer to problem number in text using $$
      integer: taken as an offset from the beginning of the stream
  to convert old style to this style
    new method of conversion
      quick and dirty perl script, ~/Documents/teaching/221/41_spring2016/old_sw/convert.pl
    original method of conversion
      I was unable to get this to work s16 for 221.
      see /home/bcrowell/Documents/teaching/205/38_fall14/old_sw
      at top and bottom of howdy block in syll.tex
        <% book_for_conversion('lm') %> # near top, but after loading syll_schedule.rb; change 'lm' to book
        <% write_for_conversion_finish %>
        writes the file "converting";  hand-edit this file:
          loses last set of problems from last chapter
          europaperA -> europaper/A
          o:parachutecalcc -> co:parachutecalc
          o:slide-uphill-with-pulley* -> *o:slide-uphill-with-pulley
          add notes
          streams are initially constucted so that they match up one-to-one with chapters; if there are
               times when there actually should be a gap in assignments from a chapter, split it into
               two streams; this happened in 205 because we go back and do calc
flags
  can be pretty much any character
  some have special handling in code (o, *, c)
  a flag such as "a" or "b" that would look like a problem part needs to have special code
        for displaying it in human-readable lists, e.g., 12 with a "c" flag has to be
        rendered as 12\int, not 12c

  self-service hw generators
  created by whiz
  hash function depends on student ID, semester, course, chapter, and list of problems (does depend
         on order of problems)
  each html file contains semester and course hard-coded; instructions warn students to check that
         these are correct; student ID is checked against a regex, and a warning is given if it doesn't match
  can input 0 for student ID to generate Joe Blow's

  last and first must be surrounded by double quotes
