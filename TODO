problems split apart sets
  is honeymoon the only one for 205?
  was screwed up when I first emailed 205, some may have printed out incorrect version; email them later in semester
  make sure solutions are right
minor
  - make hw pages more nicely printable using CSS, media="print"
  - solutions not alphabetized according to last, first; see FIXME
wish list
  - copy sets.csv to somewhere that spotter can find it; make spotter aware of it
